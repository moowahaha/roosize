Requires...
    - NodeJS (brew install node)
    - Some packages. Run ./setup.sh .

Probably good to have the following dependencies:
    - NVM (https://github.com/creationix/nvm/)
    - I'm using RVM to ensure isolation (https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)

To begin development:
    - Run "rake". This will setup the env and run all tests.

TODO:
    - Skip resizing images that are already of the correct size...
    - Totally rewrite to be safe for production use.
    - Limit request sizes.
    - Some basic time based caching.
    - Support for HTTP cache control.
    - Limit server memoray usage incase of DOS attack.
    - Introduce resize strategies (crop, stretch, pad, scale).
    - Allow limited overrides with CGI parameters (e.g. padding color).
    - Allow configurable path parsing.
    - Web proxying - so it can grab images from other websites (for S3, for example).
    - Get it to ignore/prevent favicon.ico requests!!
