Still in development...

Supports:
  - Resizing images over HTTP.
  - GIF, PNG & JPEG formats.
  - Images from the local file system as well as images on other host over HTTP.
  - Request size limits (specific as well as ranges).
  - Padding and stretching of images.
  - Configurable or overridable padding color.

Requires...
  - NodeJS (brew install node)

Probably good to have the following dependencies:
  - NVM (https://github.com/creationix/nvm/)
  - I'm using RVM to ensure isolation (https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)

To run:
  - Take a look at the config files in 'test/fixtures/*.json' for inspiration.
  - Write your own config file! (e.g. ~/my_resize_config.json)
  - Run: coffee roosize.coffee ~/my_resize_config.json
  - Request images from your browser - they should begin with /WIDTHxHEIGHT/some/image.jpg.

To begin development:
  - Run "rake". This will setup the env and run all tests.

TODO:
  - Skip resizing images that are already of the correct size...
  - Some basic time based caching.
  - Support for HTTP cache control.
  - Limit server memoray usage incase of DOS attack.
  - Introduce resize strategies (crop, scale).
  - Allow configurable path parsing.
  - Get it to ignore/prevent favicon.ico requests!!
